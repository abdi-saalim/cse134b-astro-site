    For my CSE 134B assignment, I used Astro to build this static site. Astro is
    a static site generator that focuses on sending as little JavaScript to the
    browser as possible while still letting you use components and layouts.
  </p>

  <p>
    While making this site, I learned how to create reusable layouts that wrap
    multiple pages and how to build small components like section titles that
    appear on different parts of the site. This showed me how components can
    keep a site consistent and easier to maintain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though I am still a beginner, working with Astro helped me understand
    how static site generators can quickly render many pages and organize content
    without requiring a complex frontend framework on every page.
